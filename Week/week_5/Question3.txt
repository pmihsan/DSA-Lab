BRIEF QUESTIONS:

i)Postfix Expression: 2 3 4 5 + * - 2
       The postfix or prefix expression should contain 1 operand greater than the operator.But in this expression there are 5 operands and 
3 operators.So this is not a valid postfix expression.The maximum difference between the operators and operands should be one but here it is
5 - 3 = 2 Which is greater than 1.

ii)The maximum difference between number of operators and operands is 1(For any prefix or postfix expression).

iii)Postfix expression is simple to execute when compared to the infix expression as it requires more operation to execute.
Advantages of postfix expression:
  *It is covenient for evaluating formulas on computer with stacks.
  *Postfix Exprsssion doesnot has the operator precedence and associativity.
  *They are easy to evaluate. 

iv)Prefix and postfix expression do not require parenthesis.Parenthesis is not required because the order of the operators in the postfix /prefix 
expressions determines the actual order of operations in evaluating the expression

v) Prefix Expression : + * - 2 3 4 5
                       + * 1 4 5
                       + 4 5
                       9
The output of the given prefix expression is 9.
