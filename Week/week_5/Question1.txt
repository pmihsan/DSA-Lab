BRIEF QUESTIONS:

i)For deleting a node at the begining of the list we take a sample pointer and
point it to head and move the head pointer to the next node and we free the sample
pointer.Thus there is only one modification in the linked list to delete the first node.

ii)For inserting a node in the middle of list first we would find its previous node and 
we have a sample pointer to put the address the previous node pointing to next  and we would
make the previous node to point to the new node and the next of the new node to where the sample 
pointer points.Thus here we are making two modification in the list to insert a node at the middle.
